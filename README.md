# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

As a software engineer focused on developing practical and user-friendly web applications, I created this Expense Tracker to strengthen my full-stack development skills. The app helps users manage their personal finances by tracking incomes and expenses, offering a clear view of their current balance, transaction history, and spending habits.

This project allowed me to explore key software engineering concepts like state management, CRUD operations, and dynamic rendering of data, while practicing UI design and responsive layouts.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
